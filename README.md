It is difficult to handle the huge amount of data of the patients.  It is easier to handle this data through Big Data Analytics.  There are a lot of procedures for the treatment of multiple diseases across the world.  Machine Learning is an emerging approach that helps in prediction, diagnosis of a disease.  Prediction of disease based on symptoms using machine learning.  Previously used Machine Learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest are employed on the provided dataset and predict the disease.  Now, we are using Deep Learning Artificial Neural Network for best prediction.
